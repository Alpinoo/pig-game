Game starts with rolling a dice. Its picture will be shown. After rolling the dice, player has two options; roll the dice again to increase the current score or holding the value. Holding the value will add the current score to the final score but passes the turn. If player rolls 1, current score will become 0 and turn passes.
Whenever a player wins, the layout will also change. Enjoy!
